# Espresso

1. Start by grinding **17-18 grams** of coffee. (Ensure there isn‚Äôt any coffee in the grinder hopper before you start grinding)
**Note:** The grind size is very important. For the **black machine**, the **3rd click from ‚Äò0‚Äô** seems to work best. For the silver machine, the 1st or 2nd click from ‚Äò0‚Äô is best.
2. Transfer the grinds into the portafilter basket (I suggest using the magnetic funnel).
3. Distribute the grinds in the basket; either with gentle back-and-forth shakes or by using the distribution tamper.
4. Tamp the grinds with approximately **20-30lbs** of force, taking care to ensure the surface of the tamped grinds is flat.
5. Insert the portafilter into the espresso machine
6. CHECK THE WATER LEVEL AND REFILL AS NECESSARY
7. Press the **double shot button** and watch your beautiful shot pull.

ü•õ Bonus round: steamed milk

</aside>

- Add ~**5oz** of milk to a steaming pitcher
- Turn the steam knob all the way towards the ‚Äòsteam‚Äô icon
- Once the machine starts making consistent steam, rotate the knob most of the way back to the neutral position (to turn down the steam level), insert the wand into the milk, and rotate the knob back to max steam.
- Keeping the knob near the surface of the milk, the goal is to make a ‚Äòpaper tearing‚Äô sound while starting to swirl the milk in the pitcher (this takes a lot of practice).
- Once the bottom of the pitcher is too painful to hold (don‚Äôt hurt yourself tho), turn off the steam knob and wait for the steam to stop before removing the wand from the milk.
- Swirl the foam in the pitcher before adding to your espresso.
- Enjoy üòä

# Pourover

TLDR; the ratio you should aim for is between 15:1 and 16:1; for a 10oz cup of coffee, that‚Äôs approximately 18.3g of coffee.

1. Measure out the appropriate amount of coffee and grind it into a medium-fine grind.
2. Place the filter into the pourover apparatus and wet it with hot water, then pour out the water.
3. Transfer the coffee into the filter, and place the entire rig on the scale.
4. Bloom the coffee by covering the surface with hot water, wait a minute or so.
5. Slowly add water until the desired weight has been reached.
